yt-mpv is a bash script to play, download video and audio from YouTube

(requirements: [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), [mpv](https://mpv.io/))

## Step 1

By default yt-mpv starts with three "example channels". They are not blured on the screenshot bellow.

You can find out channel ids of your favorite channels and add them to the script as you please.
